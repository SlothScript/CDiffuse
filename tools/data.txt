FADE IN:

INT COMPUTER LAB - EVENING

Two computer scientists are locking up for the day SCIENTIST 2 is standing by the door looking at SCIENTIST 1 SCIENTIST 1 is standing by a desk and starts to squat to unplug a cord connected to the bot’s head from the computer on the desk SCIENTIST 2 stops him SCIENTIST 2
Just leave it, come on No overtime I don’t want to be late to the party SCIENTIST 1 looks at him and gets back up
SCIENTIST 1
Yeah, okay Let’s go They both leave the room SCIENTIST 1 turns off the lights before closing the door behind him Unintelligible muffled chatter is heard from them after they leave Camera lingers on the door for a second before it pans over to the bot on the floor It is completely dark in the room Then the face of the bot flickers on It stands up and unplugs itself from the computer The bots head shows a simple “loading” animation with a progress bar
Once upon a time, a little boy lived He lived with his father, sucking all the money out of him Finally, the father got tired of it and screamed, "YOUNG CHILD, GO ON A QUEST, LEARN THE VALUES OF MONEY," but the child refused and decided to keep depriving his father of money Eventually, the father forced him out, giving him just a feather and some cash Unfortunately, back in those days, the outside world was a dangerous place The child decided to go to the local shop with the $100 his dad gave him
He ended up getting some seeds and a small dagger for $40 He went back to his father's house, asking for one thing Armor You see, his grandad had gone on many quests He took some of his grandad's journals to learn how to complete his quest In the journal, his grandad wrote, "On the day of March 27th, 1812, I encountered the worst beast I've ever seen A dragon, but not just any dragon A dragon that blew blue fire
Luckily, I have managed to slay the beast ” The little boy felt quite inspired after reading that He wondered what had happened to his grandad Maybe he’d keep reading the journal later A few hours later, the boy went off on his quest At first, it was just walking through the damp forest, but at 7:07, a beast came He saw a small creature, but it looked hideous It had 12 eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a long, long nose
This nose had no purpose but to smell its opponents This normally weirded out his opponents into running away, or just dying- people weren't really strong back then As the child encountered him, though, he asked a question instead of fighting "Hello Do you have any interest in buying these seeds " "Why would I want those seeds " he asked "Because these aren't regular seeds, they're magic seeds," the young boy stated matter-of-factly "These seeds turn you into a tall, fully grown… whatever you are
"

	"YOU THINK I'M NOT GROWN," screamed the thing To be fair, it was only about 3 feet tall The small thing resembled a human, and considering that it was only a few feet tall, I believe the confusion is justified Turns out that it was actually close to the tallest and biggest it could be This came as a surprise to the boy Eventually, the thing decided to buy the seeds for his children, he said The boy got almost $400 out of it
Poor children As the boy continued along the trail, he found a fork; one path led to a pink river, while the other path led to a brown river The young boy decided, after a not-so-thorough examination, to go down the path to the pink river, where a deadly frog could be found The boy did not know the frog would be deadly, so he just walked past Finally, he came upon another fork A fork in the ground "Mmmm… makes me think of the home-cooked meals my father would make
" Because of his homesickness, the young adventurer decided to head back home Along the way, he ran into the little guy with the long nose again "Hey You didn't tell the truth YOU LIED," the thing said accusingly The beans the boy had given the thing had not been magic, but the boy did not want to find out what the thing could do, so instead he kept lying, "I swear they're magic, why I used one just yesterday to turn myself from a newborn to where I am now," the boy said anxiously, “maybe their magic has expired
”
	“Why would I believe that ” the thing said, “My children are still only a few millimeters tall ” The boy took a second too long to respond to the thing, "If they’re expired, they wouldn't work, right " In his head, the boy thought, "I hope that was convincing enough " The thing suddenly made a weird squealing noise that hurt the boy's ears The deadly frog suddenly appeared from the way the boy had just come As the frog came hopping along, the thing screamed, “THIS BOY IS A LIAR
KILL HIM ”

The frog kept hopping along, making a weird noise As the boy listened closer, it started to sound a bit like a random language he decided to learn for no reason at all The frog said, in this language the boy did not yet know, "Hi ngakchia pa hi ka caah a chia tuk lo; a ngaingai ti ahcun, bawmhnak cheukhat a hman khawhmi a lo " As you could probably assume, the boy was extremely confused about what the frog had just said and astonished that the frog had just said anything
The thing responded to the frog saying, "Amah cu lihchim a si i, lihchim cu ka tuar kho hna lo Cucaah amah cu lak, Fredrick " As the boy would soon learn, they were speaking in the native language of Chin State, a language called Hakha Chin The boy had found out that the frog had something along the lines of "This boy doesn't seem all that bad, I think he needs help," and the thing had responded with, "He is terrible, get him, Fredrick
"

Suddenly, in English, Fredrick the Frog said,
“Little boy, what is your name ”
“Little Boy My parents hate me ” Little Boy responded “Well, little boy Little Boy needs to be taught a lesson about lying ” The thing said sternly “How about we all calm down and have a peaceful debate ” Fredrick the Frog suggested “Let’s start with our names Little Boy, we already know yours My name is Fredrick ”
	“I’m named The Thing ” The Thing said
“Why ” Little Boy and Fredrick the Frog said simultaneously
	After a pause, The Thing quietly responded, “Because my parents hate me ”
	“So you two have something in common ” Fredrick the Frog inquired “I guess ” The Thing said, kicking the dirt and getting it into his eyes Suddenly, The Thing realized it had free will and started screaming and lunging his sword at Little Boy The deadly frog, though, did not want this to happen So in the blink of an eye, The Thing was dead, and Fredrick the Frog was sitting atop him, and Little Boy stared with disbelief and was startled by the things Fredrick could do
Not wanting to mess with the frog, Little Boy asked, "So what d-d-do you w-want to do w-w-with m-m-m-me " He said with a lot more fear than he intended "I want to give you wisdom for your quest You want to learn the values of money and find out what happened to your grandad " Fredrick answered knowingly The boy wasn't sure what to say, once again astonished by the frog "I… how did you… What " Fredrick answered in a tone that suggested it was obvious, "You gave off a ‘I'm on a quest to find out the values of money and find out what happened to your grandad' vibe
" he shrugged this off as if it were no big deal; he knew all this just by looking at me "So about that advice I was going to give you," Fredrick said "You must…" he paused for dramatic effect, "Find Fredricka, my sister " Little Boy was confused by this "Why would I need to find your sister " He asked "Because she is the dragon that your grandad talked about in the journal," he answered "You see, I am a special frog that eventually turns into something eerily similar to a dragon
" The boy stood there astonished "But my grandad said he slayed the dragon… er, I mean your sister " The frog seemed unfazed by what the boy had just said "She is very good at forgery," the frog stated Little Boy seemed discomforted by this "Then what happened to my grandad " asked the boy “Unfortunately, I think you know ” Fredrick the Frog said, “Obviously, he was trapped in a cellar for thousands of milliseconds, and when he was released, he took a trophy, a small blue scale from the dragon he thought he had slain
”
“You see, Fredricka was only just a hatchling from her egg, and while the dragon may have looked like a great beast, it was still yet a young one, far away from its true form ” Fredrick the Frog explained

“So, if Fredricka was a baby when my grandad killed him, shouldn’t she still be dead ” Little Boy asked “No You see that trophy, the small blue scale, was an illusion While he held onto it, it slowly sucked all of his life out of him
”

“What about the journal Was any of that real ”

“Yes, most of his great deeds were true, but the end, the last page, was a masterfully orchestrated event of mimicry ”

“But you see, there was one thing that kept your grandad going for a long, long time Even though he was slowly dying, the power of one thing kept him alive ”

“Was it… me ”

Fredrick the Frog started cackling Once he got his composure, he said, “No
Not even close The power of the large red dragon's tooth is what kept him alive The tooth had magical ‘undo’ properties It can undo any mistake or action that has ever been taken by him He did not know this, though He just beared the tooth and the scale, both acting in harmony, that is, until the tooth lost its power The tooth had been doing all it could to fix the poison, but eventually it died out "

Little Boy had to recover from the knowledge of how his grandad died, and the crazy laugh the frog let out
He then asked, "So why would going to see your sister change anything You've already told me everything, right " 

"Not quite," Fredrick answered, and then thought to add, "but I will tell you no more; you must find out what it is yourself " The boy was about to argue, but then stopped himself, seeing as the frog was quite dangerous So instead, the boy said his goodbyes and set off to see this dragon/frog he sought after It took him a while to get to what he thought would be a cave, but instead was a restaurant called "Mom's Home Cooking
" The boy had seen many unexpected things over the past few days, but this may have been the 7th most unexpected thing so far And yet he still headed inside the place Partially scared because his grandad had been beaten by the monster, and partially because he was scared of what homemade food a dragon frog thing might make When he opened the door, an alarm had sounded "Welcome to 'Mom's Home Cooking', where you can get our charcoal pizza and fire-grilled cheeseburgers
" Okay, so it wasn't exactly an alarm; it just alerted the workers that someone had come in "I'm here to see Fredricka," Little Boy replied with overconfidence "Who " She questioned "Does she not work here " Little Boy asked "Nope, never heard of her " The boy stood there a second and then said, "Well, sorry for bothering you " As the boy started to walk out the door, the cashier asked, "Do you want a magma milkshake
" Little Boy left without answering The boy realized he should have asked the frog where the dragon might have been, but then he realized he might have been able to find where it was in his grandad's journals He grabbed it from his pocket and found a page that read, "On the day of February 12th, 1812 I saw this attractive bench today, I thought about asking her out, but decided against it…" If only you could have seen the look on the boy's face, it was filled with disgust and surprise
Little Boy skipped through the journal a little more until he came to the page he had first seen He went back a page and read, "On the day of March 25th, 1812, I still can't find the cave I was told about, but hopefully I can find it tomorrow " He flipped the page forward just to check, but he had made no mistake; the page for March 26th, 1812, was gone, and there were small tear marks he had not seen at first
"Where is it " he yelped, frightened After a while, he decided to try to find out who had told his grandad about where the cave might be Turns out the person he had talked to was an old pal of the family, his name was Mr Turner Thankfully, Little Boy knew Mr Turner, though he had not seen him in a while He had to go one town over, a town called Sundant Little Boy just had to hope that Mr
Turner was still alive, seeing as it had been a few decades since the journal entry After 2 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds, 3 milliseconds, 218 microseconds, and 12 nanoseconds, the boy had arrived at Sundant (He had a very good sense of time) Thankfully, it was a relatively small town, only holding 372 people, 303 horses, and 3 pigs He only had to ask around for a few minutes until he found Mr Turner Little Boy rang the doorbell
"Yes," someone answered from inside "Who is this " The boy responded with, "It's Little Boy, the grandchild of one of Mr Turner's old friends " The door opened, revealing a small living room, and Mr Turner, sitting on the couch with his wife, Ms Turner, who was just a little bit younger Mr Turner was now an old man, very frail and very wrinkly He had three kids all standing around him beside the youngest, who had just answered the door
"May I talk to Mr Turner " Little Boy asked "Why " The youngest responded "I need to find out where the monstrous monster that my grandad fought is " Little Boy answered "Okay, give me a second " Then the youngest turned around and said something to Mr Turner When Mr Turner heard why Little Boy was there, he grew aggravated, then said, "That scoundrel Johnny Boy never paid me for giving him directions "

“What ” Little Boy responded
“He told me he would pay me $10 for directions when he got back, but he never did He left and never came back ” Mr Turner screamed “Oh, you see, that's because he died ” Little Boy said matter-of-factly “what " Mr Turner said, suddenly quiet, “And what made you think I was friends with that scammer ”
“Well, he wrote in his journal,” Little Boy said, flipping through the pages, “ah yes, right here: ‘On the day of March 23, 1812, I found one of my old friends, John Turner
Turner gave me directions to a magical dragon, one that spat blue flames He described the biggest beast I’ve ever imagined ’”
“See Mr Turner He said he was friends with you ”

“Oh I guess so,” Mr Turner said, “I guess my old mind doesn’t work like it used to ”
“The cave is just over that way, to the left when you hit the big’ol rock Then continue until you see two large birch trees, making a heart shape when you stand to the left of a microscopic rock
”

“Thank you ” Little Boy said Now, Little Boy knew he was following the destiny of his grandad Not because he was finding the beast, but because he was turning into a scammer just like him, I mean, he scammed two times this journey He had left out that his grandad stated this in his journal, just after what he told Mr Turner, “Unfortunately, Mr Turner asked for $20 afterward for the directions I bargained it down to $10, but I still don’t want to pay it
So I told Mr Turner I’d pay when I get back from my journey ” 

As litttle boy 


FLOATING ALONE CONTEXT 
(Contains some info before the main events)

I’ve woken up in a white-walled room… who am I And more 
importantly, where am I I see a hatch “Tell me your name,” a mysterious voice says I’ve forgotten my name though “I don’t know,” I reply “Then you can’t pass ” The voice says Then in the poof of an instant, I felt strange… Somehow I suddenly remember my name
My name is… “My name is La-” I suddenly passed out Memories come to me I forget my name again, but I’m in a room A classroom more specifically “Who can tell me what the third farthest planet is ” I ask “IT'S THE EARTH DUH,” Adrian blurts “Some people don’t know that Adrian, so please don’t blurt,” I ask Adrian “Ugh Whatever,” He scoffs “Alright, who can tell m-” Everything suddenly goes dark And I wake up Somehow on the bed again
I walk up to the hatch I stand there waiting Expecting something to happen Then something with long claws and wrinkled hands pulls me away… Into the hatch, it pulls me Then I passed out Not knowing what’s going to happen next I wake up in the same room I can’t use all of my body parts… only my feet… But now I remember my name That has to wait though because… 
The hatch is already open FLOATING ALONE
Where the journey begins

CHAPTER ONE
The Beginnings
I woke up
Who am I Where am I I don't remember anything I am in some sort of white room I am lying in a bed, and beside me are two more beds But no one is there to lay in them I am alone The first thing I should do is find out where I am, I decide I look around All I see are white walls and a hatch in the ceiling I get out of the bed and try to open the hatch
It’s locked Suddenly, a voice comes out of nowhere “State your name” My name I don’t know my name I panicked “I don’t know ” I answered “I don't remember anything ” I added, then I realized something, “Who are you ” “Sorry, I can't answer that,” the voice said CHAPTER TWO
Stuck
Two days have passed An arm has started giving me meals I try to open the hatch again, no luck Again, the voice asks me what my name is
“Umm,” I say “Superman ” “Incorrect,” the voice says Suddenly memories come back to me I remember my name… It's Lance Smith “Is my name Lance Smith ” I ask “Accessed,” the voice says The hatch makes a hissing sound I jumped back onto my bed in shock I hit my head Black But there are memories CHAPTER THREE
Memories
“Ok,” I say “school’s over” The bell rings, and all of my third-grade students moan “As you line up we’re going to do a solar-system pop quiz
” My student’s faces brighten “Ok, what is the third farthest planet from the sun ” All of the hands in the classroom shoot up “Okay,” I say “how about,” All of my students are now jumping up and down, trying to get the highest “How about,” I pause, looking at all of the eager faces of my students “Adrian” “Well,” Adrian says “That's easy” “The third farthest planet from the sun is EARTH” “DUH” “Adrian, don't be rude, some people don’t know that
” “WELL I DON'T CARE ” “so hmph” “Can we do another question now ” asks Brayden “Sure Hmm…” “How far from the earth is the beginning of space ”	 “Brayden, you’ve been patient ” As I thought, “Ha, not really ” “Hmm,” Brayden said “uhhhmmm” “It's 100 kilometers or 62 miles ” says Adrian “DUH” “Sigh”  “Adrian please don’t blurt ” “MEH MEH MEH,” says Adrian “Next ” Ben said “Alright This one is VERY hard: How strong is the earth's magnetic field
” All of the students raise their hands at once “uhh… Rylee” “I’m pretty thsure it’th…” “It’s one Gforce stupid,” says Adrian “If you're tho thmart, how much ith a Gforth ” Rylee asks “ It’s 9 80665 newtons of force per kilogram of mass Says Adrian “D U H which stands for Dumb Ugly Human HAHAHA” “This is getting out of hand Class is over, please leave ” I say “OKAY,” says Adrian “FINE” CHAPTER FOUR
Taulight
I woke up… Who was I again
Oh yeah… I am Lance Smith… But where am I Right, the room and the hatch The hatch It is open now I went through the hatch Inside was another room… I started floating around It was kind of fun actually And then I saw it… A body… It was helplessly floating around… I think I know where I am now I look out the window I was on a spacecraft… I remember I am on a mission Project TauLight… My teammates Are dead
I look at my mummified teammate She still has her suit on On her suit it says; 302345-Valentina Roen It also has a Russian flag on it This means this is a worldwide mission I see a manual floating On it are the words; PROJECT TAULIGHT I black out at the sight CHAPTER FIVE
The man
I woke up again I got up and walked to the hatch But when I got out of the hatch the place was different
All of the lights and control panels were off Then a voice came from a black corner “You have lots of nerve coming here ” said the voice “Who are you ” I said “You don’t remember Well, here I am ” Then a man with claws for hands and a burnt face steps out of the shadows I freeze “Wha-What are you ” I stammered “Do you not remember me ” The man says “Uh… No… wait… … … yeah I don’t remember
” I say The man sighs “Hmm… Let me give you some memories” the man said It looked like he was thinking I suddenly black out Out of nowhere, knowledge starts flooding back to me But once I have it, it seems like I have known it forever CHAPTER SIX
Alarms
Alarms are going off There are screams, and people running around They are coming from my teammates The ship has gotten too close to the star They were crashing down
Soon my teammates would be gone The other two people rushed to the escape pods The alarm was going off in the engine room I was no engine mechanic but I could still try to help I ran to the reactor as fast as I could My teammates yelled to me, “THE REACTORS GOING TO BLOW UP IF WE DON’T GET THE CORE ” So I did what most people would do, and tried to prevent myself from dying by finding a core
“WARNING: REACTOR CORE IN CRITICAL STATE PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY ” the intercom said “WARNING: REACTOR EXPLOSION EMINENT VACATE AREA IMMEDIATELY” 
“WAIT AN ESCAPE POD ” I thought I ran to the pod but then the door shut Someone was in it I knocked on the door but they didn’t open it Then it blasted off I was still holding on to the escape pod, then he noticed me He opened the door quickly There wasn’t much air for all of us
By that I mean there were both of my teammates The escape pod wasn’t built for three people but it still worked Our oxygen levels were low We all tried to use as little oxygen as possible Then the alarms started in the escape pod My teammates put their helmets on and opened the door Then they kicked me I fell out of the escape pod I was so cold So, I'm tired I felt some sort of pull from the ship
It felt like gravity It was gravity But from just rough calculations I'll say it is only 0 3 G-forces I hit the airlock with a thud And blacked out CHAPTER SEVEN
Agent Frost
I walked through the hallways of the school A woman in a black suit walked flawlessly up to me “Hello Dr Smith” The woman said, “I do believe you are the man who wrote this ” She held up a paper I took it from her hands and looked at it
It was a DOGUE magazine “I don't think that I wrote that “Oh ” the woman said “My mistake” then she held up a different paper It was a paper I had written in graduate school “Umm… I think that's mine” It was about a theory I had made of microorganisms producing heat, taking in helium, and making it into carbon dioxide No one had believed me though, and the paper was passed by my professors, so I didn't know how this woman got it
“Y-yes” I repeated “I did write that” “But how did you get it ” “It was passed by my professors and counted as an unneeded, unproven theory ” “So that would make you the trash lady ” “No, not at all, Lance Smith,” said the woman quite sternly “I am Agent Frost ”

 “After some research, we found that this microorganism was real ” Frost said, “So we were told to ask ‘Lance Smith’ if he would like the organism to be named: Lance
” “W-What I would like that but can I name it something else ” “Sure, Mr Smith ” Agent Frost said “Hmm… I’ll name it… Candida ” I said The agent thought for a moment “I think that's already a name ” “Pick something else ” “Alright then,” I said I thought for a moment “Uhh…” “how about… Astrozoa” “Astrozoa, is what it should be called ” I told Frost “Alright Smith ”

CHAPTER EIGHT
The story
I woke up again
I immediately noticed that the lights were off The man was still there Just watching me… I felt different Like the ship was still being broken down But nothing was happening It was interesting But also scary Then the man said, “So Do you remember astrozoa yet ” 
“y-yes… I do I found out about it ” I told the man… He kept being more and more suspicious… Something felt strange… “So… I have a few things to tell you
” The man told me, “As you know, we are saving tau ceti ” “yes…” I said “So… this is a long story so you should sit down ” the man said “Ok” I replied, so I sat down The man told the story…

“Wait ” I say “So, you almost killed yourself trying to save me ” “Yes,” says the man I try to comprehend what the man had just told me I was pinned against the ship, and the man went through the airlock of his ship without a helmet or compressing suit
“So that's how I got my face burned We were too close to the star” the man said Oh god All of this happened and I didn’t even know I barely even know who I am I wish I knew at least some of what this person said I told him “Why did you tell me this ” “It will be useful later on Lance…” Then I blacked out My last thought was that he was suspicious and strange…


CHAPTER NINE
The Rocket
	Agent Frost came out of nowhere and she startled me
Frost told me to come with her She drove me somewhere, it looked like a research facility I wondered why she took me here So I asked her “Why have you taken me here ” “I want you to research these ‘astrozoa’” she said to me “Why ”
“Because I said so”
“Fine But I need to know the details of this ”
“Ok,” said Frost, “this is for a mission to save Earth as we know it These ‘astrozoa’ things are slowly eating away at tau ceti
Once it's gone, it will form a black hole that will suck earth in The entire solar system will be gone ”

“So if I don’t go, I'll die ” I said to the woman “You would die anyway” she told me “WHAT ” I asked, surprised “We don’t have enough fuel to get there and back ” The woman told me, “Then I'm not going ” “That's ok, you will die anyway, just if you don’t, you're taking the entire world with you
” said Frost “We already have three people who are willing to go It’s a three-person mission ” “Although we have a lower chance of actually successfully doing this mission Because the backup for the cellular-Biologist recently died in a car accident”

“Oh,” I said, surprised “Also further detail for the mission, is that the astronauts will be put into a coma for the 13-year trip to the Tau solar system” “wait wait wait wait, So, how long IS this mission
” I ask the person “You have a minimum of 13 years and 7 months,” “and you spend 13 years trying to get to the Tau solar system If you wake up, well that won’t happen But if it does you’ll need to wait all the time that's left Again, low probability” “Oh…” “Although, the ship and you will only experience 4 years due to time dilation ” Then I woke up CHAPTER TEN
Memories
“So… What do you remember, lance
” The mysterious man said, “Wha- How do you know I remembered stuff ” I ask the man “Oh… Just a hunch ” He said suspiciously I told him about what I remembered “Ah So that's all you remember ” “y-yes But now I want to know who you are ” I said to him, The man sighed, “So… you don’t remember So it is ” I blackout, and Memories that I hate come flooding back to me In a dark and dingy alleyway, two people come out to greet me ´´it is time´´ they say and I follow them to a doorway
But then they push me into the house and lock the door I am trapped I woke up again and opened the hatch The room was different It felt weird I don’t know The walls were clean I guess someone cleaned them when I was knocked out I ignored it, but something else was different, but I couldn't find out But then I thought: “Wait… if all my teammates are dead… Then… who cleaned the walls…” Anyway, I saw that the door to the “bring” was open
I went through the door, expecting to explore more I saw many MORE doors in the “bring” I noticed I used to be in the crew quarters I decided to go explore I started with the first door “Engine / Reactor” Inside was a GIANT engine CHAPTER ELEVEN
The ship
The engine room seemed so familiar I just couldn’t put my finger on it Literally, if I did I would get shocked and die I left the engine room, and one of the doors said “Escape pods”
I decided to look there next
The Escape pods were all there I don’t know how we were in space How did they come back Something weird was going on and I didn't know what I needed to leave before something happened I got sidetracked with the snack room I ate some cake (It was good) then rushed to the door Locked… “PLEASE ENTER YOUR SEAT AND BUCKLE UP ” The intercom said “What Why do we need to do that ” I couldn’t find a seat
I rushed to the cockpit Then I saw some I would never unsee…

	I SAW MY TEAMMATES When I saw them I almost fainted “Gasp He was forced into the ship ” someone said “Yeah I remember ” Someone else said Then somebody said: “You better strap up The rocket is about to launch ”

CHAPTER TWELVE
Remembering the Story
“So… this is a long story so you should sit down ” the man said “Ok” I replied, so I sat down
“So… you realize that I saved you when you hit the airlock ” He said, “ Yes, I think so ” “Good ” He told me “Now, let me tell you a few things ” “I am giving you memories I am an alien ” he says “wha-what ” I gasp “Yes Do you remember when you got random memories That was me ” He said, “Yes I do ” I answered “I have… ‘Extension nerves’ if you will ” “Anything I remember, I can have you remember
I am more responsible than many of my kind ” He said, “I would only give you your memories ” “so… so, do you have other memories for me ” I ask him “You must figure things out yourself Lance ” “Tell me what you know ” He says “Well… I am Lance Smith I don’t know my middle name, my teammates are dead I am on a ship, we are on a mission called Tau Light We are trying to save the Tau star so it doesn’t become a black hole and destroy Earth
I know you're an alien I… was forced here ” I told him It felt like he was thinking ‘ok Yes correct lance ’ So I decided to test him “And… *sniffle* My parents are… dead ”

 Then he suddenly said “Ah I didn’t realize you knew that ” After he said that I almost fainted again It felt like he was preventing it from happening What kind of monster is he He told me then that we had been on the ship for 14 years
“Gasp Does that mean that Tau is turning into a black hole now ” I say “No It means your calculations were wrong,” “I did the calculations, and we have 22 years ” “So I have to drive the ship ” “Yes ” He told me ” But anyway, back to the story,” He said “You were pinned to the airlock I opened it without anything on because there wasn’t enough time I dragged you into the ship We lost a lot of air
But you You created air for us I don’t know how but you did ” “So that is the end Do you want to say anything ” “Yes ” “Remember I saved you ”

“Wait ” I say “So, you almost killed yourself trying to save me ” “Yes,” says the man I try to comprehend what the man had just told me I was pinned against the ship, and the man went through the airlock of his ship without a helmet or compressing suit
“So that's how I got my face burned We were too close to the star” the man said “You know, I swear I saw a man at some point in this journey ” “But there is just no trace of him”
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Loose wires
The man explained to me how he can control minds, see inside minds, and move objects with his mind He has many nerve endings outside of his body Those nerves can, somehow, send off a sort of signal, almost like a force
They can also slip inside the pores of the body, connecting to the other body's nerves, and send their signals to the brain I Freaked out when I heard this but uhh… we don’t need to talk about that So technically, this guy has seen every part of my body Creepy That's an unsettling thought I decided to take a full body scan of him This is what came up As you may see, there are indeed a lot of nerve endings ”So… are you going to… do something
” I asked, nervously “Like what ”
“I don't know, like maybe kill me or somethi-”
“Oh STARS no ” He interrupted “Why would I do that to an alien I just SAVED FROM DEATH ”
“I don't know… Maybe, you were going to eat me ” “I eat ALGAE ” “Algae is not the same thing It's not actively moving and stuff ” 

“I’m going to send a Message to NASA describing you ” I said, and he instantly responded “NO
PLEASE DON’T DO NOT TELL EARTH SPACE STUDY DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT NEVER NEVER NEVER thank you ” 

“Um,” I said, uncomfortably breaking the silence “Ok” “If you do I will silence you and will make sure you don't get back to your earthworld So don’t do it ” the alien said That made me uncomfortable “All alright… So anyway what can you do with all those nerve endings Like can you control my body” I ask “Yes” he says while making my arm wave
“ohhh… Cool So uhh… Now I’m realizing the power you have… and if I was fighting you all you had to do was make me kill myself… So let's not get into a fight ” I say “Yeah ” He says CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Slurry for another coma
“Well, I'm going to the control room So I can bring us to Tau-ceti ” I told the man while jogging to the control room “Man, I'm hungry,” I mutter “I’ve gotta eat something
” I went over to the break room “Aww man, there's only a bit of good-tasting food left ” 

There are only two months of good food left and 7 years left of coma slurry Wait… hey at least this is nutritious hmm Nutrition facts: 0 004762 grams of sugar 10,000 grams of protein 17,000 grams of nutritious yucky stuff Why Why would that have THAT in it Oh, whatever I guess I'll eat it I stuffed a can of coma slurry down my throat
“ew… Ugh… So disgusting… It's like… Dissecting… a frog… again… ” I thought I felt like I was going to pass out My eyes were getting blurry “H-hey… a-alien c-c-come He-here please ” I yelled I heard footsteps getting louder He got here but it was too late I passed out… The last thing I heard was an evil laugh CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Sea
Our escape pod was crashing down to earth I was inside, our pod didn’t have air left and our suits were running out as well
Finally, we were close enough to earth that we could open the door and breathe But soon we had to close it as we were headed straight into the sea This was a special pod It was a VIP pod It had a compressor so we compressed air into our tanks and refilled them The pod crashed into the ocean We were all ready so we opened the pod door and swam up to the surface There were only three people on the surface
Someone was missing “We’ve got to save that guy,” I told them, and one of them replied, “Chill dude, he probably just is still swimming as he had the heaviest suit ” “Yeah, but what if it's TOO heavy for him to swim ” I argued “Look, I'm going down there to save him ” “NO ” I dunked into the water and started swimming down Where is he Suddenly on my radio, I heard “He- … s sur-ce com- p
” “Hes source comp ” I thought to myself Oh I’m running out of oxygen, I better get to the surface I swam as fast as I could I was almost out of oxygen and breathing when I saw the light Just a few feet to go Then I ran out of oxygen That's alright I’m almost there but then I started getting weak… My hand got out of the water but I couldn't swim up anymore I was so close… Then I felt something grasp my hand and I was pulled onto land
I took off my helmet and breathed I was safe “We've found something mystical, Magical Something cool ” They led me to a chest and they opened it Then… Then I saw something very interesting and at the sight of it, I fainted CHAPTER SIXTEEN
WARNING: OXYGEN
I woke up I was sweating I realized the man in front of me “You’ve been asleep for quite a while, about 5 hours ” I got up and looked around It was a long room of white plaster walls room where I was in a bed
I remembered this place This is where I woke from my thousand-year comma It was a really interesting place to wake up from my coma Suddenly memories come rushing back to me Dead parents Crewmembers Even my friends It's all coming back I couldn’t describe the feeling, not even a tad Well,7 I can a tad, It felt good to know everyone, but now I also know that they're all dead It's so sad :(

 I started walking to the control room trying to find out as much as I could
But then all of a sudden lights flash and alarms scream and all of this happened in a fraction of a second I ran to the control room to see what happened Warning we have hit an asteroid in section B-2 of the Food room This is a critical break and it must be fixed immediately “Oh that's not good,” I thought to myself “If we don’t have food we’ll die and never get to the Tau solar system and all life will be destroyed
” 

WARNING SHIP OXYGEN LEVELS DEPLETED 17% LEFT “17% We’ll never save Tau Ceti with 17% of our original amount of oxygen EVEN THAT WAS SMALL” I thought to myself 16% the automatic voice said At this rate, all the oxygen would be gone by the next hour What time is it 3:57 Well at 4:40 we would have like 4% left This is so bad… WAIT I gotta get the air compressor QUICK Finally, I got to the compressor
But for some reason there were already compressed air tanks “huh I guess there are a few compressed air tanks for emergencies” I mumbled to myself I put the new ones on and got a spare on with me as well “Alien Alien ” I shouted as I got my suit on “What Also, it's kinda annoying you shouting ‘Alien, Alien ’ you know ” “Come on we gotta fix the place” 

NOTICE: B-2 FOOD HAS BEEN FIXED the automatic speaker said
“Oh phew ” “But wait… How much oxygen is left ” OXYGEN LEVEL: 6% FUEL LEVEL: 69% CREW ALIVE: 1 WARNING UNKNOWN LIFE FORM IN SHIP “unknown lifeform ” I ask no one The alien disappeared Gasp What if the alien wasn’t a good guy… What if… Maybe he isn’t as good as I thought… I ran out of there as fast as I could CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Math in a coma
As I ran down the corridor a door sealed itself shut
I entered the code ‘’I’m sorry but the ship is on lockdown and no doors can be opened at this moment If you or your teammates didn’t cause the lockdown, calm down and hopefully the ship will shut off the lockdown Eventually ” an automated voice said I kicked the door and nothing happened except an excruciating pain in my toe It felt like it had been broken Then an alarm sounded A small hole opened in the wall, only big enough for a needle to fit inside
An opaque gas started shooting out of it “Warning: please stand still while you are medically helped ” I didn’t care what the voice said I moved all I wanted to I start feeling different kind of nice, kind of… happy…

All I can see is black I’m awake, but I can't see “Ow ” I blurt as a tube is pulled out of my throat “Ahhh,” I say in an understanding tone “I got put in a coma again
” 

The voice comes on again, “What’s 2+2 ” “four ” “Please enter your answer in the keypad” I couldn’t see the keypad so I couldn’t press 4 on it Suddenly my vision came back to me I don’t know how it just came I pressed 4 “CORRECT What is 37+84*2 ” “uhh, I don’t kn-” “Please enter your answer in the keypad ”
 “SHUT UP”
 I yelled to the voice Alright 37 + 84 is… uhh… 111 no, 121
I think yeah, 121 Multiply that by two then it's… 242 Yeah I entered 242 into the keypad “INCORRECT PLEASE REMEMBER PEMDAS NOW YOU NEED TO RACE THE COMPUTER ” “What is 4 + 7 ” the voice said, then instantly it said “TOO SLOW ITS 11 2 WRONG” “WHATS 15 + 15 ” “TOO SLOW ITS 30 3 WRONG” “Can you let me have a chance ” “TIME DELAY UNTIL CORRECT ANSWER SET TO 2 SECONDS ” “WHATS 1+1+2+4+6
” “ ” “INCORRECT THE ANSWER WAS 14 4 WRONG” “WHAT 6*2 ” I pressed 12 “CORRECT FINAL SCORE: 2 / 6 3 Wrong due to time delay 1 Wrong due to incorrect answer Please continue your mission ”

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
The truth
I woke up in the room again I guess I fell asleep again “Ok,” I said to literally nobody “Time to find the alien guy” I got up and walked around I saw that somebody had patched a hole in the ship
But who I thought walked around In the control room, the engine room, the storage room, and the centrifuge operation room Nowhere (Oh I guess I should Note that the way the centrifuge works is: There are two cables in the middle of the ship When the centrifuge is activated, the two halves of the ship; storage and everything else detach from each other, and the cables extend them apart from each other Then both sides of the ship boost in opposite directions, and the ship halves spin around
)

 Then I checked the medical area There he was, he was fiddling around with the medical AI code I went to check it out I ran over to the medical 
area He was just standing there acting like nothing was happening “oh, hey Lance…” “Come into this… thing…” he said then muttered something under his breath I was suspicious of him “All alright…” I told him He could tell I was suspecting him I went into the machine but before I did that when he wasn’t looking I reprogrammed it to nothing
I went in CHAPTER NINETEEN
 Bad Lies

I waited in the machine’s glass capsule “So…” I stalled “what does this do ” “Oh, nothing really ” the man said Then I heard the capsule door lock “WAIT ” I blurted “Don't do that ”
“why not ” asked the man “ummm… For safety measures ”
“What is unsafe about this ”
“if um- i-if something goes wrong, I can get out ” I lied “Oh,” said the man, “that is a good reason,”
“But not good enough
” He slammed his clawed hand down onto the AI activation button Nothing happened He tried again Still, Nothing “What ” he shrieked, then he turned to a snarl,
“what did you DO” “Umm… I did nothing Nothing at all…” I said I was always bad at lying “WHAT DID YOU DO ” “Nothing OBVIOUSLY” I lied “Tell me or I’ll kill you ” The man snarled, “Wait, wouldn’t you kill me anyway if I told you or not ” I asked the man
 “Uhh yeah, I guess
” He said, so I said: “SO THEN I’M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GET THE SATISFACTION OF KILLING ME WITH A WELL PLANNED OUT AND GOOD SCHEME ” “”

“Fine ” he hissed “Then I'll kill you in cold blood ”
CHAPTER TWENTY
HOOOOGO
I grabbed the tubing inside the capsule and smashed the glass I got out of there and punched the man He barely flinched “ow my fist hurts,” I told him “um hmm Why is that so Lance
” “uhh because uhh… I smacked it ” I lied “Yeah Sure ya did lance ” The man said “Welp, I gotta go to come up with another scheme to kill ya ” He said “WAIT I DIDN’T SMACK MY HAND YOUR MY HAND SMACKED MY HAND” I yelled at him “What ” “You controlled my hand and made it smack my hand ” I told him “DID NOT ” he said, “DID TO ” I said It went back and forth like that for a while
“OK, WHATEVER I NEED TO SCHEME ALRIGHT,” the man said “Alright cool ” The man walked out and also walked out The man had left, and I had gone to security to check it out He was in the food room He was poisoning the good food “Well, I'm not eating any good food from now on,” I muttered to myself He then ran out and went to the engine room He tapped on the engine then pressed a button 3 times then said something like “Whommbo” “Hoooogo” Something like that
Then a passage opened up and he walked through it I couldn’t track him any further I ran to the engine room and tapped on the engine, pressed a button 3 times and said: “WHOMMBO” “BZZZ” a buzzer went Now he knew I was here, and that wasn’t good I did the same thing but instead of saying ‘WHOMMBO’ I said “HOOOOGO” A secret door opened up and I walked in “Hello… You’ve made a big mistake coming here, Lance
” The man said Well, not man, alien CHAPTER TWENTY ONE
THE FINAL FIGHT
I was focused on the security cameras Too focused So focused I didn't notice the man coming up behind me “Your dead lance You never should have come here ” He almost stabbed me but suddenly I ducked “WHAT” the man shrieked Then suddenly I was frozen in place Then the man grew into a giant man Dominos were placed in a line next to me
I was in a dark room with a huge lamp above me Then the man flicked the dominos The chain reaction hit me and it hurt a lot My back felt broken I tried to get up but then the table turned into a chess board I was a pawn and a queen was in front of me It was about to hit me but then the scene changed It was a gladiator arena We both had swords I ran to him but he disappeared and teleported to the other side
He charged at me I ducked As he was turning back, I stabbed him in the back I could see that the sword punctured his entire body “Man, I'm strong…” I told myself Then the man pulled the sword out of him not even a scratch Oh I guess I'm not as strong as I thought “I’ll always be alive Lance Always ” the man said as he faded from existence Then my vision started getting blurry and I collapsed on the ground
I fainted again Or did I I’m still thinking and stuff “Ahh… uhh… W-Whoogo H-Huhogoo ” 





CHAPTER TWENTY TWO
Dreams

I bolted straight up in the bed I was panting and sweating I heard a voice in my head “Don’t worry Lance, I’ll always have power over you… hahaha,”

I got out of my bed and started searching for the man Nowhere Then everything started glitching Even me Then it all disappeared The hand was holding me and in a horrifying, cracked, and raspy voice, someone said
“Do you see my power Lance You will never leave ” The voice said then it threw me out of the hatch and locked it again I fell asleep on the bed, which is not a smart idea when somebody’s trying to kill you In my dreams, I see the man laughing at me and weird things like dominos and other things happening Whenever I wake up after that it feels like someone has been seeing those dreams as well and that's when I realize… that someone IS… And someone is creating something around those
I can feel it…
